	<h1>The Human Tendency to Make Poor Decisions</h1>
	<p>Humans tend to simplify the complex world around them in order to make decisions. Whether a choice alters someone’s morning coffee order or alters the course of their life, neither is immune to the often unknown fallacies and pitfalls of decision bias. Decision bias is a common phenomenon that occurs when individuals make judgments or decisions that are influenced by factors that are not directly related to the decision at hand. There are several different types of decision bias, each of which can impact the accuracy and fairness of our judgments and decisions. Different types of biases, such as Confirmation Bias, Expedience Bias, Availability Heuristic, Planning Fallacy, and Hindsight Bias, can all affect the decision-making process of my Independent Study Project, and it is imperative that my team knows how these biases can affect us and what we should do to overcome them.</p>
	<h2>Confirmation Bias</h2>
	<p>Confirmation Bias is a type of decision bias that occurs when individuals seek out information that supports their existing beliefs while ignoring or dismissing information that contradicts those beliefs. This can lead individuals to make decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information, which can have significant negative consequences. For example, an individual who is committed to a particular political ideology may only seek out information that supports their beliefs, and ignore information that suggests their beliefs may be incorrect. As a result, their decisions may be based on a distorted view of reality, leading to poor decisions and outcomes. The effect of Confirmation Bias to double down on issues in the face of opposing information is seen as people go down “rabbit holes,” or a rapid stream of affirming information in order to strengthen a point of view, on platforms such as TikTok as people are suggested videos that only aline with their minority viewpoint (Vedantam, 2015-present). Many of these cases are so extreme that when they confront compelling evidence from the other side, they claim that it does not compare to the mountain of evidence they have on their own side. This particular type of Bias could affect our team's independent study project in dozens of ways. For example, if we intend to use particular software to perform eye tracking, Confirmation Bias could present itself in only viewing resources on the benefits of that particular software while lacking resources on the software’s negative traits or the benefits of other software. In order to avoid this bias, it is important that my team is able to adapt and considers the opposing viewpoint thoroughly and objectively before making a decision.</p>
	<h2>Expedience Bias</h2>
	<p>Expedience Bias is a type of decision bias that occurs when individuals prioritize short-term gains over long-term benefits. This can lead individuals to make decisions that may be beneficial in the short term but may have negative consequences in the long term. For example, an individual may choose to cut corners or take shortcuts in order to save time or money, without considering the potential negative impacts of their actions. As a result, their decisions may be based on a narrow focus on immediate gains, rather than considering the broader implications of their actions. Because the Expedience Bias is based on the human desire for clarity,  it is often caused by “a rush to judgment without considering all the facts” and leads to skewed decisions (Abkowitz, 2022). My team could experience this bias in decision making because we are both prone to procrastination, and the Expedience Bias is heightened under a time constraint. If we come to face a time constraint, it is important to give more weight to our decisions and avoid making hasty ones so that we are not affected by this bias.</p>
	<h2>Availability Heuristic</h2>
	<p>Availability Heuristic is a type of decision bias that occurs when individuals rely on information that is readily available to them, rather than taking the time to carefully consider all of the relevant information. This can lead individuals to make decisions based on incomplete or potentially misleading information, which can have significant negative consequences. For example, an individual may rely on the opinions of others, rather than conducting their own research, when making a decision. As a result, their decision may be based on the opinions of a select group of individuals, rather than a more comprehensive view of the situation. Availability Heuristic can also commonly be seen through the use of search engines like Google. Google will display the most popular web pages, as well as those that have been boosted through paid advertisements, to its users. The Availability Heuristic bias could appear in my team’s independent study project if we click on the first google search result available and consider it to be the most accurate. In order to avoid this bias, it is important to use multiple sources of information as well as many different types of sources so that the entire project is not based on a small, skewed sample.</p>
	<h2>Planning Fallacy</h2>
	<p>Planning Fallacy is a type of decision bias that occurs when individuals underestimate the time and resources required to complete a task, leading to unrealistic expectations and goals. This can lead individuals to make overly optimistic plans and commitments, often caused by the human “inability to say no”, which may be difficult or impossible to fulfill (8 Types of Bias in Decision Making, 2022).  For example, an individual may underestimate the amount of time and effort required to complete a project, leading them to make unrealistic commitments to others. As a result, their plans may be based on overly optimistic assumptions, which can lead to disappointment and frustration when the project fails to meet their expectations. This may affect my team’s independent study project because we may take on more work than we can handle in the allotted time. In order to avoid the Planning Fallacy, it is important to consider each task we chose to complete and evaluate whether it is feasible to complete it in the allotted time.</p>
	<h2>Hindsight Bias</h2>
	<p>Hindsight Bias is a type of decision bias that occurs when individuals believe that events that have already occurred were predictable and inevitable, even when this was not the case. This can lead individuals to view events with a distorted sense of certainty, which can hinder their ability to learn from past experiences and make more accurate judgments and decisions in the future. For example, an individual may believe that a particular outcome was obvious and predictable, even if there were many potential outcomes and the actual outcome was not clear at the time. As a result, their understanding of the situation may be based on a distorted view of the past, which can lead to poor decision-making in the future. Our team may be affected by this bias upon the completion of our project if it does not turn out the way we hoped it would. To avoid this issue, after our project is completed, it is important that my team evaluates what went well and what did not so that we can learn from the decisions we made rather than claim that we knew they would have a bad effect all along.</p>
	<h2>Ramifications</h2>	
	<p>These are just five of the many different decision biases that could possibly affect my team and the decisions within my teams project. Although these biases are sometimes inevitable due to the diffifulty to be aware of them, learning about the nuances of these fives types has helped me become more aware of the gravity and importance I need to give to all decisions in the development process of my teams independent study project. Every decision can affect the result of the project and it is important to be open to other's ideas as well as to actively seek them out.</p>
