      <h1>Week 1 ~ 2-Jan-2023</h1>
      <h2>Software Development Engineer</h2>
      <p>The primary role and responsibility of a Software Development Engineer is to meet with clients in order to be able to understand and meet the criteria for the software they develop. Software is universally used across all industries in order to streamline operations through the use of applications. The primary job of a software engineer is to program and design the software, but other tasks such as testing the software at various stages of development and accurately communicating the ins and outs of the software are important as well. Finally, another major job for software engineers is to maintain and repair the software in the face of any bugs.</p>
      <p>I do not have much experience coding real projects or software, but a project such as this one would be a great opportunity to develop my skills in other useful ways. This job would definitely take work and effort on my part as it would not come easy to me, but it certainly would be an invaluable experience.</p>
      <h2>Quality Assurance Engineer</h2>
      <p>The primary role and responsibility of a Quality Assurance Engineer is to design and administer tests that identify and fix bugs and discrepancies in a project in addition to preventing them all together. The quality assurance engineer may offload some of the work in a setting such as game development to playtesters in order to more efficiently detect problems in the game. A quality assurance engineer will work most closely with the software development engineer as they need to communicate the issues with the code for them to solve.</p>
      <p>I think I would be great for this job because I have an attention to detail and like to make sure everything is accurate. In addition, I like to explore and understand all aspects of a product which makes me prone to finding discrete errors in a product.</p>
      <h2>Project Manager</h2>
      <p>The primary role and responsibility for a Product Manager is to plan and execute the project as well as being in charge of the team working on the project. In addition, they must be efficient in regards to the use of resources such as time and money. They work most closely with the team leads of each sub section of the project.</p>
      <p>I think I would do great in this position because I can be very organized and I also have great leadership and communication skills, both of which are vital in an effective project manager.</p>
      <h2>Product Manager</h2>
      <p>The primary role and responsibility for a Product Manager is to communicate with the client to figure out what objectives the product will fulfill. In addition, they ensure that the product stays close to the original vision of the client. They must be familiar with the market and what must be done for the success of the product.</p>
      <p>I think I would struggle as a product manager because market research and finances do not come easily to me. With enough work and effort, I think I could pull the position off, but I believe I am better suited in others.</p>
