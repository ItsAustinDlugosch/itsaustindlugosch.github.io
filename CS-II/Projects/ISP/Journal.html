      <h1>Week 13 ~ 27-Mar-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>This week, the home screen for our application was completely polished up and we began focusing primarily on the eye tracking software. Each of the buttons was finally formatted correctly and placed in the correct locations on the front page. We still need to resolve the issues with the excess windows and the problems with the eye tracking software still need to be ironed out, but we are getting closer. These are some links to commits and issues on our GitHub repository. <a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-SpyScreen/commit/00bdc15a27fc1202a6cb4baba089393c2aa9a718">Large Commit 1, </a><a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-SpyScreen/commit/1a3a94605082bdd7a3ed6ef82212f88806975841">Large Commit 2, </a><a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-SpyScreen/issues/14">Issue 1</a></p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>My partner and I had a few scheduling conflicts this week. Motivation to keep working on the project is surprisingly low, but I know we will keep at it next week until we finish.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>Part of the issue with burnout from developing the product is a lack of collaboration between my partner and I. It is important that teams work together to solve problems or challenges. If we worked together more often, problems that may ruin spirit could be solved much easier.</p>

      <h1>Week 12 ~ 20-Mar-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>The technical challenge this week was futile efforts to utilize open-source eye tracking software. The ones that were free and open-source were not of a high quality and would not function for the product we intend to create. It is important that the software is easily able to detect eyes when the person is directly in front of the camera, and the soft we plan on using seems to have trouble even with such a trivial task.</p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>There was many stressful assessments and assignments in many of my partner and I's classes. Additionally, due to our professor being out for the week, we managed to get a little side-tracked. We decided that we would work harder next week to compensate.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>There were no interpersonal challenges this week. My partner and I work extremely well togethere and we have not faced any arguments during the process of the development of Spy Screen. We have had disagreements but we have always managed to come to a conclusion in a civil manner.</p>

      <h1>Week 11 ~ 13-Mar-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>The buttons created for the main screen of the application are functional, but some time this week, the color changed to be white and they were not spaced evenly. It is difficult working with Python and Qml, but I was able to fix it.</p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>There were no scheduling conflicts this week. My partner and I really need to sit down and discuss what still needs to be completed for the success of our project. A timeline is incredibly important.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>There were no interpersonal challenges this week except for our continued dedication towards increased communication about what tasks we are doing and what we have been learning.</p>

      <h1>Week 10 ~ 6-Mar-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p> There were no technical challenges this week. My partner and I continued to work on the application and make sure that the quality was maintained throughout development.</p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>There were some extracurricular events after school that chipped away at the time my partner and I usually have to work on the project, so we decided we would work extra next week.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>My partner and I have begun to work very well together and it is very comfortable working in a two person team even though there is more work to be done for each person.</p>

      <h1>Week 9 ~ 27-Feb-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>There is a rather difficult issue creeping up in our PyQt6 application that does not seem to affect MacOS computers. Each time our button is clicked, another window of the application appears only for Windows systems. I am not sure how to solve this issue, but I am dedicated to figuring it out.</p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>There were no scheduling conflicts this week, and my partner and I worked efficiently with the time we had in class.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>My partner and I decided this week that we would share what we had learned that week about Python, Qml, or the eye tracking software. This way, we can stay on the same page and learn from each others mistakes and save time in the end.</p>

      <h1>Week 8 ~ 20-Feb-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>Following the minimum viable product presentation, my partner and I have a better idea of what we need to accomplish. We recieved invaluable advice and suggesstions from our colleagues and professor.</p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>My partner and I were exceptionally busy this week and had little time to spare to work on the project.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>There were no interpersonal conflicts this week. My partner and I are beginning to understand each other and recognize patterns in our workflow.</p>

      <h1>Week 7 ~ 13-Feb-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>This week we continued to struggle with little knowledge of PyQt6 or Qml, but progress was being made towards a Minimum Viable Project.</p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>There were no scheduling challenges this week.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>My partner and I were not very communicative about what we were doing this work while working on the project and we decided that we will be more transparent.</p>
      
      <h1>Week 6 ~ 6-Feb-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>I do not know how to use VSCode yet. I am still currently learning Python and I know that my partner will assist me in my learning of the application and language.</p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>We have not had any scheduling conflicts this week except for a band concert we both performed in taking up some valuable time. In addition to this, we both have jobs and this takes time out of our scedule.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>There were no interpersonal challenges this week. My partner and I debated some key decisions about our minimal viable product, but we are able to come to a similar conclusion in the end.</p>

      <h1>Week 5 ~ 30-Jan-2023</h1>
      <h2>No work done this week due to inclement weather.</h2>

      <h1>Week 4 ~ 23-Jan-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>We are still trying to find an acceptable framework to work on our porject other than Tabby. It is a little difficult to work with and something else local to our computers is more beneficial. We are both struggling finding something that will work for btoh of us. I am confident, however, we will get one by the end of this week.</p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>My partner and I have worked a couple times outisde of school attempting to find the correct framework and tools to be able to accurately complete our task. We both had little personal time this week to work on our project.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>I have not had any interpersonal challenges this week with my partner. We have worked well together and continue to be efficient with time and resources.</p>      


      <h1>Week 3 ~ 16-Jan-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>It has been difficult to find frameworks for out project. We are attempting to use PyQt6 for the framework of our application. We are still searching for a good software to use for eye detection. We have broken the task into two compenents, detecting new eyes or lack of eyes on screen and switching the tab/turning off the screen. </p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p> My partner and I text each other to comunicate and decide when to work and th fundamental decisions about our minimun viable product and how we should approach problems. We are both in band and that has lead to some conflicts and trouble finding time to work together.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>This week went very well with our accomplishments and efficency. We working as a team and feeding off of each others ideas. I am optimistic that we will remain friends fter this project.</p>      

      <h1>Week 2 ~ 9-Jan-2023</h1>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>      
      <p>This week, my partner and I have begun searching for an open source eye tracking software that we can configure for our project. This has been challenging because all of the possiblilites we have found so far such as Pupil Eye Tracking, GazeRecorder, and recently HaarCascades have been difficult or unfeasible to implement. Without much experience in python, being able to install and manipulate these softwares has been challenging and I am relying on information from blogs and other internet posts.</p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>It was difficult to find time to complete task for the ISP. We have each other's phone numbers and plan to work together outside of school. We are both very busy and finding time has been difficult.</p>
      <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>My partner is a very delligent worker and has been great to work with. We have helped each other stay on task and find new tasks to accomplish. We have strong team morale. It has not been difficult to make decisions.</p>
      
      <h1>Week 1 ~ 2-Jan-2023</h1>
      <h2>Software Development Engineer</h2>
      <p>The primary role and responsibility of a Software Development Engineer is to meet with clients in order to be able to understand and meet the criteria for the software they develop. Software is universally used across all industries in order to streamline operations through the use of applications. The primary job of a software engineer is to program and design the software, but other tasks such as testing the software at various stages of development and accurately communicating the ins and outs of the software are important as well. Finally, another major job for software engineers is to maintain and repair the software in the face of any bugs.</p>
      <p>I do not have much experience coding real projects or software, but a project such as this one would be a great opportunity to develop my skills in other useful ways. This job would definitely take work and effort on my part as it would not come easy to me, but it certainly would be an invaluable experience.</p>
      <h2>Quality Assurance Engineer</h2>
      <p>The primary role and responsibility of a Quality Assurance Engineer is to design and administer tests that identify and fix bugs and discrepancies in a project in addition to preventing them all together. The quality assurance engineer may offload some of the work in a setting such as game development to playtesters in order to more efficiently detect problems in the game. A quality assurance engineer will work most closely with the software development engineer as they need to communicate the issues with the code for them to solve.</p>
      <p>I think I would be great for this job because I have an attention to detail and like to make sure everything is accurate. In addition, I like to explore and understand all aspects of a product which makes me prone to finding discrete errors in a product.</p>
      <h2>Project Manager</h2>
      <p>The primary role and responsibility for a Product Manager is to plan and execute the project as well as being in charge of the team working on the project. In addition, they must be efficient in regards to the use of resources such as time and money. They work most closely with the team leads of each sub section of the project.</p>
      <p>I think I would do great in this position because I can be very organized and I also have great leadership and communication skills, both of which are vital in an effective project manager.</p>
      <h2>Product Manager</h2>
      <p>The primary role and responsibility for a Product Manager is to communicate with the client to figure out what objectives the product will fulfill. In addition, they ensure that the product stays close to the original vision of the client. They must be familiar with the market and what must be done for the success of the product.</p>
      <p>I think I would struggle as a product manager because market research and finances do not come easily to me. With enough work and effort, I think I could pull the position off, but I believe I am better suited in others.</p>
