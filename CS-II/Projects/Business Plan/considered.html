	<h2>Sophia Tran - Available Tables - <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/sophia-tran/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link</a></h2>
	<p>Sophia Tran’s ISP, Available Tables, is a very interesting idea because it tackles a real-life problem in an interesting manner. I would be most excited to create an interface that allows restaurant owners to digitize the layout of their restaurants. Additionally, the future availability of tables could be predicted based on the size of tables and possible progress updates on where a particular consumer is at on their meal. This project got me interested and thinking, but I feel that it would not challenge me enough on areas that I am weak in or not familiar with such as hardware.</p>
	<h2>William Clymire - Dx3 - <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/william-clymire/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link</a></h2>
	<p>William Clymire’s ISP, Dx3, tackles a problem that is personal to me. I struggle with staying awake at times, so being able to help myself and others through a project would be beneficial and rewarding. Additionally, Will provided ample information about the gravity of the problem and the ways they could solve it, in addition to the leg up they would have over their competitors. I chose not to do this project because at the end of the day if I have the willpower to run the machine, I might as well just grab a cup of coffee without the hassle.</p>
	<h2>Boden Chen - Webshop - <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/bo-hong-chen/Digital%20Portfolio/webshop/plan.html">Link</a></h2>
	<p>Boden Chen’s ISP, Webshop, seems like a very useful tool; however, I feel that it may not be feasible. Because the project would be entirely open-source, the revenue stream and profit would be minimal. Additionally, I feel that 2 people are not enough manpower for the project because there are many quirks and bugs likely to arise with this large undertaking. The question of what CSS features the interface would support would need to be considered because CSS has many specific options and complex methods of drawing and styling the canvas.</p>
	<h2>Nimo Rozanes - The Cat - <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/nimrod-ohayon-rozanes/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link</a></h2>
	<p>Nimo Rozanes’ ISP, The Cat, is a very cool concept and has an impressive real-life application. I was interested in the project based on his descriptions, but I feel it lacked a concrete plan to finance the project. I think it would be amazing to drive and operate something that you helped build and program with your own two hands, but I lack knowledge in vehicles and I feel that I wouldn’t be a good contributor to the team.</p>
	<h2>Onik Hoque - Sheltersafe - <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link</a></h2>
	<p>Onik Hoque’s ISP, Sheltersafe, tackles a truly serious issue that we must all act on to preserve our world and environment. His plan to assist those in need by providing locations to a shelter during a natural disaster sounds good on paper; however, who will update the number of people at each shelter and their amount of food? It is unrealistic to assume that all shelters will meticulously update their stats for the users of the app. I chose not to do this project because I also wanted to focus on other skills that I still need to improve on.</p>
	<h2>Brett Kaplan - SchoolFood - <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link</a></h2>	
	<p>Brett Kaplan’s ISP, SchoolFood, is an intriguing undertaking for all students of Allen High School. We witness the lack of efficiency caused by a large student population each and every day. With the shortage of faculty in key areas, such as the lunch lines and janitorial staff, the problem is more important to address than ever. Brett’s idea of an online queue could prove effective if handled correctly and in a timely manner, but I fear that the implementation will require serious changes to how Allen’s lunch lines work currently. It may be difficult for students to locate their lunch after it is done, and the problem of stealing other students' lunches is sure to arise. For these reasons, I fear that it may not be feasible to implement such a solution at Allen High School.</p>
	<h2>Jakob Mcpherson - <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jakob-mcpherson/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link</a></h2>
	<p>Jakob Mcpherson’s ISP is very interesting to me because AI and machine learning is something I would love to learn and improve my skills in. I am well aware the future of our society is surely rooted in AI technology to streamline monotonous tasks. However, I fear that I would be of not much use to the team due to my lack of experience and knowledge. On the other hand, I certainly would love to use this product. I look forward to checking back on this project upon its possible completion as I feel my place is as a consumer rather than a producer.</p>
	<h2>James Dungan - On Track - <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/james-dungan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link</a></h2>
	<p>James Dungan’s ISP, On Track, is an incredible idea to assist with people who want to get back into nature following the devastating pandemic that has closed so many of us from it. As a nature enthusiast, I think that bringing more people back to the national parks is a noble cause. However, I fear that the app would lack enough challenge and room to improve. I am not seeing a particular challenge or obstacle that I am itching to overcome like in other projects that have piqued my interest. Although the cause is just, I fear there is not enough substance to justify the projects over others.</p>
	<h2>Mason Graham - unIQue - <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mason-graham/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link</a></h2>
	<p>Mason Graham’s ISP, unIQue, has some personal value to me. I enjoy helping others overcome difficulties and challenges, so a platform that can help others while still keeping the audience interested in helping themselves is a great cause. I think that challenges arise in the form of providing an alternative to therapy. There is no substitute for human interaction in the form of therapy, and it would be irresponsible to emulate that. However, simply put, when the project lacks that level of complexity, I fear that it has been reduced to a recreation of Cool Math games.</p>
	<h2>Drew Eldridge - <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link</a></h2>
	<p>Drew Eldridge’s ISP encompasses many aspects that are challenging and interesting. I have always wanted to learn more about facial trackers and recognition. Additionally, its important to me that this project has room to grow and increase in complexity if time permits. I am excited to learn more about the hardware aspect of how computers function, process data, and execute tasks. In Computer Science I, I primarily focused on basic algorithms and learning a clean foundation for programming. Going into Computer Science II, I hoped to learn more about the other ways parts of the computer interact with each other, and I know that this project will help me learn more.</p>
