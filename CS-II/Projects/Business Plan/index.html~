	<h1>TV360</h1>
	<h2>Identity</h2>
	<p>TV360 manufactures easy to use and install TV and monitor mounts that are capable of rotating 360 degrees.</p>
	<h2>Problem</h2>
	<p>Televisions and monitors are often not visible at certain angles, and TV360 allows for a more customizable space.
	<h2>Solution></h2>
	<p>Our TV and monitor amounts can track people around the room and swivel to match their movement. Additionally, TV360 can be configured via remote control input to rotate on demand.</p>
	<h2>Target Market</h2>
	<p>The target audience is adults and college students who want to maximize the space in their homes and the capabilities of their TV screens and monitors.</p>
	<h2>Competition</h2>
	<p>TV mounts are sold worldwide by a variety of large international companies that focus on a variety of products. TV360 will specifically specialize in TV mounts.</p>
	<h2>Revenue Streams</h2>	
	<p>TV360 will sell primarily online and to local stores. Additionally, we can recieve orders through calls from infomericals.</p>
	<h2>Marketing Activities</h2>
	<p>TV360 will advertise through infomercials and targeted TikTok and Instagram advertisements, and TV360 will communicate directly with customers through social media.</p>
	<h2>Expenses</h2>
	<p>First, the materials for the design including plastic, steel, cameras, and remote control transmitters. Second, the cost for advertisements. Finally, the cost of distribution.</p>
	<h2>Team and Key Roles</h2>
	<p>Currently, the only team member is the founder, Austin Dlugosch, but as the project expands, TV360 would like to add people that can assist in the five main areas of the project: optimizing the design, movement tracking, remote control, advertisement, and quality assurance.</p>
	<h2>Milestones</h2>
	<p>As the business grows, TV360 would like to expand its outreach further to distant markets via delivery.</p>
