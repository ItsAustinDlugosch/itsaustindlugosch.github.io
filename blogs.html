    <p class="paragraph">The BYOD policy change at Allen High School hit me like a brick in the face, but I should have known it was bound to happen sooner or later. Allen ISD administration is always trying to get a leg up on their students and teachers in terms of what they can or cannot do. Sometimes its government regulation, but most of the time its just a completely stupid power struggle. School districts across the nation are dealing with a nation-wide teacher shortage, and Allen ISD's solution is to make using personal technology significantly harder for both students and teachers. Being unable to use personal technology such as cell phones will only hurt teacher and student satisfaction. There are other methods to mitigate cheating other than banning personal devices alltogether. However, I suspect that is not the intention, rather it is to surveil everyone. No matter the reason behind it, this change will affect the way many classes, espescially computer science, operate.</p>
