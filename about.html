    <p class="paragraph">Hello, my name is <strong>Austin Dlugosch</strong>. I love spending time with family because they are a large inspiration for me to keep learning. In school, I am a junior at <strong>Allen High School</strong>, and I am involved in many different activities like <strong>Band</strong>, <strong>Computer Science</strong>, and <strong>Spanish Honor Society</strong>. While I am still learning the basics of Computer Science, I am an inquisitive person and love to learn new tricks and methods to solve problems and create. I love the struggle in solving problems and especially the feeling of that realization moment. I hope to improve in all of the many aspects of Computer Science, but specifically in the areas of software development and video game design.</p>
