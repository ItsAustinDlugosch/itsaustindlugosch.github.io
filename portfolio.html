    <p class="paragraph">A <strong>digital portfolio</strong> is an excellent way to publish your own accomplishments and feats in a clean and organized way. It's open for the public so <strong>anyone</strong> can view who you are and what it is that you do. They provide an opportunity to display what you have worked on and push you to keep <strong>improving</strong> and <strong>adding</strong> to what you have already done.</p>
