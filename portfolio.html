    <p class="paragraph">A <strong>digital portfolio</strong> is an excellent way to publish your own accomplishments and feats in a clean and organized way. It's open for the public so <strong>anyone</strong> can view who you are and what it is that you do. They provide an opportunity to display what you have worked on and push you to keep <strong>improving</strong> and <strong>adding</strong> to what you have already done. It has pushed me to be creative and make sure everything is exactly as I want it on my page. It has been an invaluable experience to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>
